*NOTE* ALL ENTRIES ARE CASE SENSITIVE AT THIS TIME.
As you come in and out of the loop the application will inform you that you make type "exit" to finish. Typing exit is the only way to finalize your addition to the list.
You will type "yes" to enter a new member's information, and "no" to view current member information.
You will answer the questions in the order their asked to add member information for basic tracking of inquiry resolution.
When vieiwing a member. Please enter the number correlated with the member to receive their data and determine if a call back is needed.
Was attempting to add a function to clear all member with "Yes" under resolved on each Saturday -- this will be added in a later build.


Targeted requirements are as follows:
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
